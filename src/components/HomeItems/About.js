                    I  worked and studied in Civil Engineering as a high-rated graduate in 2008. Up until 2015, I have participated in design of multi-span structral 
                    bridges and also worked on a construction of  Asphalt pavements of different projects in Easter-Africa and Europe. Moving into another part of the world in 2016 gave me a great opportunity to 
                    join to another era in computer science leading me to work in different organizations in the capital of Canada in web developing projects using different CMS. 

                    I am now a Tech. support assistant, website administrator and Social Secretary in a diplomatic office located in Ottawa. I've a passion for computer science, information technology and on 
                    different technical aspects of modern technology.
                
                    I  have a self-confident and can interact with my co-workers as I had so may great opportunities to work with teams in technical, managerial 
                    and diplomatic level. 
                    
                    Well being said about my professionalism, and for more I have a great tendency of learning new expriances from different aspects of fields; i.e. I have had a great 
                    expriance to play with numbers like accounting MGT and commercial income Tax analysis , transportaion business, photography and video editing. As matter of fact, 
                    photography is now one of my part-time job that I take seroiusly.
